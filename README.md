# NetExec

This is the open source repository of `NetExec` maintained by a community of passionate people. This project was initially created in 2015 by [@byt3bl33d3r](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/), known as CrackMapExec. In 2019 [@mpgn_x64](https://github.com/mpgn_x64/) started maintaining the project for the next 4 years, adding a lot of great tools and features. In September 2023 he retired from maintaining the project.

Along with many other contributors, we (NeffIsBack, Marshall-Hallenbeck, byt3n33dl3, and zblurx) developed new features, bug fixes, and helped maintain the original project CrackMapExec.
During this time, with both a private and public repository, community contributions were not easily merged into the project. The 6-8 month discrepancy between the code bases caused many development issues and heavily reduced community driven development.

With the end of mpgn's maintainer role, we (the remaining most active contributors) decided to maintain the project together as a fully free and open source project under the new name **NetExec** 
Going forward, our intent is to maintain a community driven and maintained project with regular updates for everyone to use.
